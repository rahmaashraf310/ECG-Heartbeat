# ECG-Heartbeat
This dataset is composed of two collections of heartbeat signals derived from two famous datasets in heartbeat classification, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The number of samples in both collections is large enough for training a deep neural network.

This dataset has been used in exploring heartbeat classification using deep neural network architectures, and observing some of the capabilities of transfer learning on it. The signals correspond to electrocardiogram (ECG) shapes of heartbeats for the normal case and the cases affected by different arrhythmias and myocardial infarction. These signals are preprocessed and segmented, with each segment corresponding to a heartbeat.
